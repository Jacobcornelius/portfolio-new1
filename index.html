				    <h3>A Little Bit <span class="text-primary"> About Myself</span></h3>
				    <p class="lead">“ Life  is partly what we make it , and partly what it is made by the friends we choose.”</p>
                    <p class="lead">Few things have such a huge impact on happiness and the enjoyment, depth and plain fun of life as the friendships we have.It could be the love with our partners, family members , co-workers and the people we have known for a few years now or since we kids. So I’d like to start this by looking back and share some of the best advice on this topic from the people who walked in this field over the past hundreds and thousands of years. </p>
                    <p class="lead"> “DON’T MAKE FRIENDS WHO ARE COMFORTABLE TO BE WITH. MAKE FRIENDS WHO WILL FORCE YOU TO LEVER YOURSELF UP.”</p>
                    <p class="lead">Hello everyone , myself Jacob Cornelius and I’m 19 years old. Currently I’m persuing my Bachelor’s Degree (B. E CSE) 2nd year in Panimalar Institute of technology. I like to invent or discover new methodologies in Programming Languages and computer technology. And I’m very much interested in the field of “Machine Learning” and “Data Science”. So I learned to coding in some Programming Languages like “Python, C Language, C++ and some basics of JAVA.</p>
                    <p class="lead">In meantime , I attended many crash course in NPTEL , Coursera and also in Study Monk. Currently I’m learning Machine Learning and Web development in Studymonk and Google Cloud Computing in NPTEL. Apart from studies I have some more skills which I developed since childhood like painting portraits and sketching live things. And I also used to play Basketball , Cricket , etc…</p>

    					<p>A “I can accept failure, everyone falls at something. But I can’t accept not trying.“This is my favourite quote which is said by “Michel Jordan”.Since its invention in 1891, basketball has become one of the most popular sports in the world. Even though you can quickly acquire the basic skills to play basketball, becoming a truly skilled player takes a lot of exercise and dedication. I won many leagues in district and state level. In the age of 9 I learned to play and till now I been keep practising.</p>

    					<img src="images/painting.jpeg" alt="My Hobby">
    					<p>“Painting is just another way of keeping a diary.”
This is a famous quotes by Pablo Picasso.
I learned to draw and paint when I was a kid. I painted many portraits, Natural scenes and live objects and architecture.
And I also got many awards in my schools and some other competition. When I got bored I used paint something and it gives relaxation.
